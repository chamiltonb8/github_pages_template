## Strike 1
Far too often, I see (and have created) visualizations that are cluttered, hard to read, and honestly look unprofessional and messy. This is a tutorial that will walk you through how to use matplotlib to create clean, easy to read and professional looking visualizations!! We will be using a heatmap as an example, but the principles can be applied to any type of visualization.

## Strike 2
This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of python and matplotlib! So with that, we'll dive right into it.
