# Hello! I'm Cameron üëã

Welcome to my data science portfolio! I'm super excited to share with you some of the projects, skills and knowledge I've been building as I learn more about data science and analytics.
I have a passion for using data to solve problems and tell stories, and this portfolio is a reflection of that journey! 

## üéì About This Portfolio

This portfolio shows my work learning data science. Each project includes:

- My code with documentation
- Visualizations I created
- What I learned and discovered
- And any fun insights I've gained along the way

I built this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills I'm Learning

- **Programming**: Python, Python libraries (matplotlib, pandas, numpy, etc.), C++, and R
- **Visualization**: Creating charts with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and GGplot2
- **Data Collection**: Getting data from files, websites, and APIs
- **Analysis**: Finding patterns and answering questions with data (this is my favorite part!)
